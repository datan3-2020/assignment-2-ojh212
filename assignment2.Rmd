In this assignment you will work with relational data, i.e. data coming from different data tables that you can combine using keys. Please read ch.13 from R for Data Science before completing this assignment -- https://r4ds.had.co.nz/relational-data.html.

## Read data

We will work with three different tables: household roster from wave 8 (*h_egoalt*), stable characteristics of individuals (*xwavedat*), and household data from wave 8 (*h_hhresp*).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
# You need to complete the paths to these files on your computer.
Egoalt8 <- read_tsv("C:/Users/Liv/OneDrive - University of Exeter/Second Year/Term 2/POL2094 Data Analysis iii/Github/datan3/Data/6614tab_10EB1BA6123C0D95E60D28E156AEA8F7_V1/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_w8/h_egoalt.tab")
Stable <- read_tsv("C:/Users/Liv/OneDrive - University of Exeter/Second Year/Term 2/POL2094 Data Analysis iii/Github/datan3/Data/6614tab_10EB1BA6123C0D95E60D28E156AEA8F7_V1/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_wx/xwavedat.tab")
Hh8 <- read_tsv("C:/Users/Liv/OneDrive - University of Exeter/Second Year/Term 2/POL2094 Data Analysis iii/Github/datan3/Data/6614tab_10EB1BA6123C0D95E60D28E156AEA8F7_V1/UKDA-6614-tab/tab/ukhls_w8/h_hhresp.tab")
```

## Filter household roster data (10 points)

The **egoalt8** data table contains data on the kin and other relationships between people in the same household. In each row in this table you will have a pair of individuals in the same household: ego (identified by *pidp*) and alter (identified by *apidp*). *h_relationship_dv* shows the type of relationship between ego and alter. You can check the codes in the Understanding Society codebooks here -- https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/documentation/mainstage/dataset-documentation.

First we want to select only pairs of individuals who are husbands and wives or cohabiting partners (codes 1 and 2). For convenience, we also want to keep only the variables *pidp*, *apidp*, *h_hidp* (household identifier), *h_relationship_dv*, *h_esex* (ego's sex), and *h_asex* (alter's sex).
(ego's sex is coded in Egoalt8 as h_sex now)
```{r}
Partners8 <- Egoalt8 %>%
        filter(h_relationship_dv == 1|h_relationship_dv == 2) %>%
        select(pidp, apidp, h_hidp, h_relationship_dv, h_sex, h_asex)
```

Each couple now appears in the data twice: 1) with one partner as ego and the other as alter, 2) the other way round. Now we will only focus on heterosexual couples, and keep one observation per couple with women as egos and men as their alters.

```{r}
Hetero8 <- Partners8 %>%
        # filter out same-sex couples
        filter(h_sex + h_asex == 3) %>%
        # keep only one observation per couple with women as egos
        filter(h_sex == 2)
```

## Recode data on ethnicity (10 points)

In this assignment we will explore ethnic endogamy, i.e. marriages and partnerships within the same ethnic group. First, let us a create a version of the table with stable individual characteristics with two variables only: *pidp* and *racel_dv* (ethnicity).

```{r}
Stable2 <- Stable %>%
        select(pidp, racel_dv)
```

Let's code missing values on ethnicity (-9) as NA.

```{r}
Stable2 <- Stable2 %>%
        mutate(racel_dv = recode(racel_dv, `-9` = NA_real_))
```

Now let us recode the variable on ethnicity into a new binary variable with the following values: "White" (codes 1 to 4) and "non-White" (all other codes).

```{r}
Stable2 <- Stable2 %>%
        mutate(race = case_when(
                between(racel_dv, 1,4) ~ "White",
                racel_dv > 4 ~ "non-White"))
```

## Join data (30 points)

Now we want to join data from the household roster (*Hetero8*) and the data table with ethnicity (*Stable2*). First let us merge in the data on ego's ethnicity. We want to keep all the observations we have in *Hetero8*, but we don't want to add any other individuals from *Stable2*.

```{r}
JoinedEthn <- Hetero8 %>%
        left_join(Stable2)
```

Let us rename the variables for ethnicity to clearly indicate that they refer to egos.

```{r}
JoinedEthn <- JoinedEthn %>%
        rename(egoRacel_dv = racel_dv) %>%
        rename(egoRace = race)
```

Now let us merge in the data on alter's ethnicity. Note that in this case the key variables have different names in two data tables; please refer to the documentation for your join function (or the relevant section from R for Data Science) to check the solution for this problem.


```{r}
JoinedEthn <- JoinedEthn %>%
        left_join(Stable2, by = c("apidp" = "pidp"))
```

Renaming the variables for alters.

```{r}
JoinedEthn <- JoinedEthn %>%
        rename(alterRacel_dv = racel_dv) %>%
        rename(alterRace = race)
```

## Explore probabilities of racial endogamy (20 points)

Let us start by looking at the joint distribution of race (White vs. non-White) of both partners.

```{r}
TableRace <- JoinedEthn %>%
        # filter out observations with missing data
        filter(!is.na(egoRace), !is.na(alterRace)) %>%
        count(egoRace, alterRace)
TableRace
```
 
Now calculate the following probabilities: 1) for a White woman to have a White partner, 2) for a White woman to have a non-White partner, 3) for a non-White woman to have a White partner, 4) for a non-White woman to have a non-White partner.

Of course, you can simply calculate these numbers manually. However, the code will not be reproducible: if the data change the code will need to be changed, too. Your task is to write reproducible code producing a table with the required four probabilities.


```{r}
TableRace %>% 
        # group by ego's race  to calculate sums
        group_by(egoRace) %>%
        # create a new variable with the total number of women by race
        mutate(sum_women_race = sum(n))  %>%  
        # create a new variable with the required probabilities 
        mutate(prob_women_race = n/sum_women_race)
```

## Join with household data and calculate mean and median number of children by ethnic group (30 points)

1) Join the individual-level file with the household-level data from wave 8 (Hh8) (specifically, we want the variable for the number of children in the household - h_nkids_dv).
2) Select only couples that are ethnically endogamous (i.e. partners come from the same ethnic group) for the following groups: White British (1), Indian(9), and Pakistani(10).
3) Produce a table showing the mean and median number of children in these households by ethnic group (make sure the table has meaningful labels for ethnic groups, not just numerical codes).
4) Write a short interpretation of your results. What could affect your findings?

```{r}
Hh8_and_Indiv <- JoinedEthn  %>%
        left_join(Hh8, by = NULL) %>%
        select(egoRacel_dv, alterRacel_dv, h_nkids_dv) %>%
        filter(egoRacel_dv == 1 & alterRacel_dv == 1| egoRacel_dv == 9 & alterRacel_dv == 9 | egoRacel_dv == 10 & alterRacel_dv == 10) %>% 
        mutate(Couples_Ethnic_Group = case_when(
                egoRacel_dv == 1 ~ "White British",
                egoRacel_dv == 9 ~ "Indian",
                egoRacel_dv == 10 ~ "Pakistani")) %>%
        group_by(Couples_Ethnic_Group) %>%
        summarise(Mean_Number_of_Children = mean(h_nkids_dv, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Number_of_Children = median(h_nkids_dv, na.rm = TRUE))
Hh8_and_Indiv       
```
The results from the table above show that:

- For ethnically endogamous Indian couples, there are a mean number of **0.9553753** and a median number of **1** children in the same household.

- For ethnically endogamous Pakistani couples, there are a mean number of **1.8108747** and a median of **2** children in the same household.

- For ethnically endogamous White British couples, there are a mean number of **0.5651314** and a medain of **0** children in the same household. 

These results suggest that households with Indian couples have an average of **1** child living in the same household. Pakistani couples have an average of **2** children living in the same household and White British couples have an average of **0** children living in the same household. 

These results suggest that Pakistani couples have on average more children in their households compared to Indian couples and White British couples.

However, certain factors could affect these findings: 


1. This is only a sample of the population, there are more white than non-white participants in the survey and so the survey results may not be representative of the average amount of children per household by ethnic group for the whole population.

2. **Non-response bias** can affect the findings.Some couples may refuse to answer how many children are in their household. For example, if they have more children living in one household than UK Property law allows, they may conceal their answer on the survey to protect themselves. This could result in biased inferences if those who respond the the question are systematically different to those who dont respond to the question; e.g. if White British couples refused to respond more compared to Indian couples. 

3. **Misreporting** could also affect the findings. Respondants may lie about how many children they have in their household. This can be a source of bias.

4. This data is from 2016-17, since then the amount of children that people are having/adopting or living with is likely to have changed over time, these findings therefore might not be reflective of the current situation and cannot be generalised as such.
